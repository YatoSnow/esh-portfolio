I am a Data Scientist driven by the intersection of analytics and real-world impact.
</p>

<p>
My journey into data science began during my master’s program, where I built my first machine learning project. 
At the time, the work was academic. Later, while operating businesses I co-founded, I realized that the same analytical 
principles could directly influence operational performance and revenue decisions.

<p>
Applying data science in business environments changed everything. Unlike academic research, where impact is often 
measured by publication, business analytics produces immediate, measurable outcomes. By leveraging machine learning, 
feature engineering, and optimization techniques, I helped improve pricing decisions, streamline operations, and 
increase efficiency across complex, fast-moving workflows.

One of my proudest achievements was building a system that analyzed weekly incoming truck inventory in minutes — 
a process that previously required days of executive review. This allowed faster, more strategic decision-making 
and created a meaningful competitive advantage in inventory selection and timing.
</p>

<p>
I am motivated by solving messy, high-stakes problems where decisions matter. 
From pricing analytics and large datasets to 2D image data and optimization systems, 
I enjoy designing models that turn complexity into clarity.

Today, I position myself as a professional Data Scientist focused on building scalable, 
strategic, and impact-driven solutions.
