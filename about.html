      <p style="font-size:18px; margin-top:0;">
        I am a Data Scientist driven by the intersection of analytics and real-world business impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey into data science began during my master’s program, where I built my first machine learning project.
        At the time, the work was academic. Later, while operating and co-managing businesses,
        I realized that the same analytical foundations could directly influence operational performance,
        pricing decisions, and revenue outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Applying data science in business environments changed my perspective.
        Unlike academic research, where impact may take time to materialize,
        operational analytics produces immediate and measurable results.
        By leveraging machine learning, feature engineering, and optimization techniques,
        I helped streamline workflows, accelerate decision cycles, and improve strategic inventory selection.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my proudest achievements was designing a system that analyzed weekly incoming truck inventory
        in minutes — a process that previously required multiple days of executive review.
        This not only created a competitive advantage in timing and selection,
        but also freed leadership capacity for higher-level strategic initiatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        My background combines <b>M.S. Biomedical Engineering</b> with graduate studies in
        <b>Electrical Engineering</b> and <b>Business Management</b>.
        Today, I focus on building scalable, impact-driven data solutions —
        turning complex, messy datasets into clear, actionable strategy.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
        I am driven, ambitious, and strategic — motivated by solving high-stakes problems
        where data-informed decisions truly matter.
